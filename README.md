## About

This is simple Mantil project template which will demonstrate few Mantil concepts. It has single Lambda function which holds list of programming excuses (strings). API has methods for:
* getting [number of items](https://github.com/mantil-io/template-excuses/blob/601410bb2c25d1ea9c825c026087ffde5edcae1f/api/excuses/excuses.go#L45) in the list
* [clearing](https://github.com/mantil-io/template-excuses/blob/601410bb2c25d1ea9c825c026087ffde5edcae1f/api/excuses/excuses.go#L50) list
* [loading](https://github.com/mantil-io/template-excuses/blob/601410bb2c25d1ea9c825c026087ffde5edcae1f/api/excuses/excuses.go#L67) into list from some URL   
* [getting](https://github.com/mantil-io/template-excuses/blob/601410bb2c25d1ea9c825c026087ffde5edcae1f/api/excuses/excuses.go#L56) random item from the list. 


First concept to show is use of environment variables. In this case we will use project wide environment variable. They can be also set at individual stage level. That is a way to configure same lambda function to work differently in different stages. In our case we will use environment variable to set [preload_url](https://github.com/mantil-io/template-excuses/blob/601410bb2c25d1ea9c825c026087ffde5edcae1f/config/environment.yml#L36) which will be used during lambda function cold start to load initial list of excuses. If not set application will start with empty list of excuses.

Second concept is integration between UI and API. Project has simple [web page](https://github.com/mantil-io/template-excuses/blob/master/public/www/index.html) which will show random excuse, and on each click call API to get new random excuse.  

## Creating Project

`mantil new` command has flag `--from` for creating a new project from existing template. 

We will use this set of commands to create project from template, create new stage and deploy project to the stage. 

```
mantil new my-excuses --from https://github.com/mantil-io/template-excuses
cd my-excses
mantil stage new development
```

After that we can load project web page at URL:
```
open $(mantil env --url)/public/www/
```

Web page should look like:

![web page](/excuses.png)

Click on the excuse text to get new random text.

## Invoking Methods

Let's call some API methods:

```
mantil invoke excuses/count

mantil invoke excuses/random
```

We can use equivalent curl methods:
```
curl -X POST $(mantil env -u)/excuses/count
curl -X POST $(mantil env -u)/excuses/random
```


Explore `mantil logs` command. It will show logs from the lambda function
execution. First form will show all logs. Second only REPORT lines.

```
mantil logs excuses
mantil logs excuses --filter-pattern "REPORT"
```


## Loading list of excuses

To clear excuses list execute:
```
mantil invoke excuses/clear
```
and check:
```
âžœ mantil invoke excuses/random
Error: 500 Internal Server Error
X-Api-Error: no excuses
```

To load new list of excuses:
```
mantil invoke excuses/load --data '{"URL": "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/orf/db8eb0aaddeea92dfcab/raw/5e9a8958fce65b1fe8f9bbaadeb87c207e5da848/gistfile1.txt"}'
```

## Web interface

index.html page from public/www folder is availabe at [root]/public/www/ URL.
You can get root URL by:

```
mantil env -u
```

or open in the browser with this terminal command:
```
open $(mantil env -u)/public/www/
```


## Random excuse in terminal

If you have yq tool in you terminal, this is use full one liner to be ready when some manager comes into room: 

```
watch -t -n 5 'curl -s -X POST $(mantil env -u)/excuses/random | yq -r .Excuse'
```



## Environment variable

Try to remove preload_url from config/environment.yml. After deploy function will always start with empty list.
